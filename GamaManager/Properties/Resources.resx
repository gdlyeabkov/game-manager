    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Most user issues can be resolved using our Office ware game manager support site, available at https://support.Office ware game managerpowered.com/. If Valve is unable to resolve your issue and a disagreement remains between you and Valve, the parties should resolve such disagreement in accordance with the procedure described in this Clause.

A. All claims must be resolved by arbitration except those related to intellectual property, illegal use, piracy or theft

YOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. THIS INCLUDES, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO: (i) ANY ASPECTS OF OUR INTERACTIONS, (ii) THIS AGREEMENT, OR (iii) YOUR USE OF THE Office ware game manager, YOUR ACCOUNT, OR DEVICE.

Section 11 does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to any government agency, federal or local, that may, by law, exercise relief against you.

Arbitration is the consideration of a case by a disinterested arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than litigation and provides less publicity. It follows different procedures than the court and is subject to very limited review by the courts. The arbitrator shall issue a written decision and, at the request of the parties, provide justification. YOU AND VALVE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING YOUR DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.

Written notice to Valve must be sent to: ATTN: Arbitration Notice, Valve Corporation, P.O. Box 1688, Bellevue, WA 98004.

C. Arbitration Rules and Fees

U.S. Federal Arbitration Law applies to Section 11 to the extent not inconsistent with the laws of your country of residence. Arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (or in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules, if the Consumer Arbitration Rules do not apply) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as set forth in this Agreement. The rules are available at: http://www.adr.org. The arbitrator must take into account the terms of this Agreement.

The AAA will manage the arbitration. Outside the United States, Valve will select a neutral organization that provides arbitration services using these or similar rules. Arbitration may be conducted by presenting documents, by telephone, or in person in your country of residence or other place agreed upon by both parties.

If your claim is $10,000 or less, Valve agrees to refund your filing fee and your share of the costs of the AAA arbitration, including your share of the arbitrator's compensation, unless the arbitrator determines that your claims are unfounded or abusive . Valve agrees not to recover its attorney's fees or other legal costs unless an arbitrator determines that your claims are unfounded or abusive. If your claim is in excess of $10,000 and the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules do not apply, the costs of the AAA arbitration, including compensation to the arbitrator, will be shared between you and Valve in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.

D. Binding Individual Arbitration Only

You and Valve agree not to put forward and not participate in collective or representative claims, common claims put forward by private duties, lawsuits related to informational activities, or in collective or representative arbitrations, even if the AAA procedures allow this. THE ARBITRATOR CAN ONLY RULE IN FAVOR OF A PRIVATE PARTY AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL ACTION. You and Valve also agree not to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this Agreement and the parties to any other action or arbitration.

This Agreement prohibits collective or representative arbitrations. The Court has the exclusive right to decide on any application.

E. What happens if the provision of Clause 11 is found to be illegal or unenforceable

If any provision of Clause 11 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect (provided that the arbitration award is made prior to commencement of any litigation), unless the recognition provisions unlawful or unenforceable would permit collective or representative arbitration. In such a situation, Clause 11 will be deemed completely unenforceable and the claim or dispute will be resolved in court.

12. MISCELLANEOUS ⏶

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if any provision of this Agreement is found by an arbitrator or in court to be illegal or unenforceable, it shall be enforced to the fullest extent possible and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. . Clause 11.E. governs cases where certain provisions of Clause 11 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) are found to be illegal or unenforceable.

You agree that this Agreement, the rights under it and the remedies guaranteed by it apply only to the parties to the Agreement.
