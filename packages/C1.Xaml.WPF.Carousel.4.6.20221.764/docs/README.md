## About

The ComponentOne WPF Carousel library includes CarouselPanel, a virtualizing panel control that arranges child elements along an arbitrary 3D path. You can use CarouselPanel with any items control to turn a flat list of items into a virtualizing carousel with true 3D perspectives and scrolling animation.
